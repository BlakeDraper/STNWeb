# STNWeb

STNWeb is the data management application for the Short-Term Network (STN) database. It is built in AngularJS and using leaflet -- specifically the [angular-leaflet-directive](https://github.com/tombatossals/angular-leaflet-directive) -- to power the map components.

Note that this is version 2 of STNWeb, released June 2016, which replaces the legacy ASP.NET version found [here](https://github.com/USGS-WiM/STNWeb1).
